Appointment Application - C195 Software II
Purpose - The purpose of this application is to create an appointment scheduling app. One that
          allows the user to create a customer and schedule appointments with that customer to
          company contacts. The app prevents appointment overlap and displays time in local user time
          in addition to showing the user reports.
